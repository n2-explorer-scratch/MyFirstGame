# MyFirstGame
My first webpage with processing.js.

# Info
There are 3 main files:

1. "**index.html**" - contains main html
2. "**style.css**" - contains css styling
3. "**gameSourceCode.js**" - contains game program

index.html links to the Processing file and the CSS file and uses the data for webpage content. The game is displayed using a <script> tag and a "canvas" tag.

EDIT: Found out that this program is not working. This might not work for some time, so it will be archived temporarily.
